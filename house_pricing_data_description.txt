Data Description: Residential homes sold in Ames, Iowa, between 2008 and 2010.
Task: Learn and predict the SalePrice

Split: Indicates whether each row belongs to the training or server evaluation portion of the data.
       labeled → these rows include the target variable (SalePrice) and are the ones you’ll use to train and validate your model locally.
       leaderboard → these rows do not include SalePrice; you must generate predictions for them and upload those predictions to the platform for scoring.
       This column is provided only as a reference — it is not a feature for model training.

Id: A unique identifier for each property (row).
       It does not influence predictions but must be included in your submission file so the platform can match your predictions to the correct entries in the leaderboard data.
